# :warning: Deprecation notice :warning:
ImgurSniper was a project I initially created as my first _"real"_ C# project while still in school. I had lots of fun developing it, but obviously made some messes in the codebase such as in-efficiency, bugs, and inconsistent styling conventions. I learned a lot from this project, and want to thank everyone of you who downloaded it, starred it and created issues in here. I'm now archiving this repository, as I have no interest in maintaining the codebase, and honestly a full rewrite with my knowledge now would be a way better decision anyways. It still works on my machine but if it doesn't work on yours then I'm afraid I can't help you. Try [ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX).
Check out my [other repositories](https://github.com/mrousavy) for some other possibly interesting projects.

> PS: ImgurSniper is also in the 2020 GitHub Archive Program, pretty cool to think there's some floppy disk out there containing buggy C# code.

## Why choose ImgurSniper?
Compared to other Screenshot software, ImgurSniper is **as fast as sharing Images can get**. Also, ImgurSniper will upload directly to [imgur](http://www.imgur.com), which gets a direct Image Link 
(Meaning the Link is Image only, so you can embed the Image, or share it with Software that can preview _Image URLs_, like _Discord_, ...)

# How to use
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>PrintScreen</kbd> (depending on your Preferences) to start **ImgurSniper** Snap Mode!
**Easily capture and share a moment** by drawing a Rectangle with your _Mouse_ to automatically upload it to [Imgur](http://www.imgur.com)!
Optionally, press <kbd>Space</kbd> to _switch Mode_ and **paint on the Screen**!
You can now **share the Link** that has been **copied to your Clipboard** with everyone!

(To change the behavior of **ImgurSniper**, right-click the _Icon in your Tray_ and click **Settings**)

(See more Info at **ImgurSniper Settings -> Help**)
