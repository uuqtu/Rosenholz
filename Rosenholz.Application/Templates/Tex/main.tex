My relationship with \cite[p.34]{Welge.2017} entrepreneurship has always been one of great respect and interest. The parents of the children in my school years who had their businesses were always \citeA[]{Welge.2017} the ones who were more flexible in their scheduling. Not that they had more leisure time, but the time they had to work they could divide up for themselves and arrange it in the way that was best for the moment. This has always fascinated me, especially because my parents always worked in shifts and many activities were incredibly difficult to coordinate. So, I have often dealt with the idea of becoming self-employed and thus also to obtain self-determination. When I had the chance to attend a course on entrepreneurship during my second degree, it was clear to me that I had to seize the opportunity. The impression this course made on me at the time and the experiences from my childhood turned respect into interest. In the world of start-ups, the personalities you meet in this scene differ from those in a large corporation clearly by certain characteristics. Especially, the inner drive and dedication formed taking inspiring impressions for me.
